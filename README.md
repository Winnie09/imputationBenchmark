# Benchmark for single-cell RNA-seq imputation methods

### For the community

**NEWS** 

Since we have received many emails requesting processed data or imputed data that used in this benchmark work (thanks for the interest!), we decided to submit the data as an ExperimentData package to [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/BiocViews.html#___ExperimentData). We appreciate your patience and will update you as soon as it is released. 

Recently we received many emails from researchers who want to apply
this evaluation pipeline in some projects, or introduce these analyses in courses. If you have questions about the codes location of any analyses, or want to 
have a copy of the processed data in this work, please email me at whou10@jhu.edu.  We are more than happy to provide these. We appreicate your interest and patience.
